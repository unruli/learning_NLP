Data comes in many different forms: time stamps, sensor readings, images, categorical labels, and so much more. But text is still some of the most valuable data out there for those who know how to use it. Natural Language Processing (NLP), I will use the leading NLP library (spaCy) to take on some of the most important tasks in working with text.

spaCy is the leading library for NLP, and it has quickly become one of the most popular Python frameworks. Most people find it intuitive, and it has excellent documentation.

spaCy relies on models that are language-specific and come in different sizes. You can load a spaCy model with spacy.load.

A common task in NLP is text classification. This is "classification" in the conventional machine learning sense, and it is applied to text. Examples include spam detection, sentiment analysis, and tagging customer queries
